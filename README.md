## Problem Statement

Many supermarket chains face significant challenges in monitoring their operational costs, efficiently managing stocks, allocating staff schedules, and planning marketing campaigns. The decision-making process of managers in these areas plays a crucial role in the development of supermarkets, as it can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and, consequently, financial results.
The implementation of this dashboard in a supermarket chain's information system aims to support managers in the detailed analysis of operational, financial, and marketing data from their stores. This provides a valuable source of information for:

  • Overall performance of the establishments over time, allowing decisions on the continuity of operation for each, with a focus on financial sustainability. <br />
  • Stores, product categories, and customer segments that generate the most profit for the supermarket, enabling decisions on where to invest to maximize financial performance. <br />
  • Sales volume and costs for each type of product, to decide how to distribute stock among different stores and avoid product stagnation. <br />
  • Demand patterns throughout the days of the week, ensuring an adequate stock level and efficient allocation of resources across different establishments. <br />
  • Peak customer traffic periods to determine staff scheduling and when it is necessary to open additional cash registers.<br />
  • Most sought-after products throughout the day to decide how to position them for easy replacement, including allocating more staff during specific periods.<br />
  • Sales volume for different product categories, in order to decide which products should have promotions and the days these promotions should be offered.<br />
  • Consumption trends among different customer segments to determine which marketing campaigns should be implemented and the target audience for these campaigns.

This dashboard is a crucial tool for long and medium-term decision-making, providing strategic information that will enable driving sustainable development for supermarkets, ensuring more efficient management aligned with the needs of the market and customers.
